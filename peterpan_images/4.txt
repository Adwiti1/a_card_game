Stage 1: 
Peter Pan's rise of power

Scene 1: The Living Room

Peter's Mother: Peter, it's time you started thinking about your future. You can not stay a child forever.
Peter's Father: Responsibility is part of growing up, son. You must accept it.
Peter Pan: (stomping his foot, crossing his arms defiantly) No! I will never grow up or accept the responsibilities of an adult! It's not fair!
Peter's Mother: (sighing) Peter, everyone has to grow up. It's a part of life.
Peter Pan: (shouting) I don't care! I'll never grow up, and you can't make me!
(Peter's parents exchange worried glances as Peter storms offstage, slamming the door behind him.)
Peter's Mother: (rubbing her temples) Where will he go?
Peter's Father: (gravely) Into the unknown, I fear.
Narrator: And so, Peter Pan, in his defiance, ran from the constraints of adulthood, seeking freedom in the wild heart of the forest.
